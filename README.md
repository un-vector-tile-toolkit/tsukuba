# tsukuba: UNVT Portal Ledger

![](tsukuba.jpg)

![](steel.jpg)

This is a ledger of Misoras (Raspberry Pi with the United Nations Vector Tile Toolkit (UNVT)). We started this ledger since UN-GGIM WG-Disasters Conference 2020 in Tokyo. We started the identification number from 321 following [produce-320](https://github.com/un-vector-tile-toolkit/produce-320).

Number 400 and bigger are open to public. Please send a pull request if you want to add your Misora to this ledger. 

Misora is still a tentative name.

# hostname convention
- We use `raspberrypi.local` when we use the `cross-cable` connection.
- We use `m${number}` as the hostname. The host name for the machine number 343 will be `m343`.
